                                <p>For anyone that is not familiar with the song "We Are the World", here is a little background about it:</p>
                                
                                <p>In 1985, inspired by Band Aid's "Do They Know It's Christmas?" in the UK, the American entertainer and activist Harry Belafonte decided to organize a US equivalent. He planned to have the proceeds donated to a new organization, United Support of Artists for Africa (USA for Africa).</p>
                                
                                <p>The organization would provide food and relief aid for the 1983–1985 famine in Ethiopia, which killed about one million people. Belafonte also planned to set aside money to help eliminate hunger in the United States of America.</p>
                                
                                <p>It has been a long time since we had a major movement/cause coalesce around a song.... Could "The Mingle Effect" be 2024's "We Are the World" moment? Can music spread the word? Win a Grammy?</p>

                                <p>For those who have not watched the movie "Ready Player One", a quick synopsis of the movie would be: In the near future, society has found itself immersed in a Virtual Reality game called "The Oasis".</p>
                                
                                <p>This is where people can create alter-egos and spend countless hours living in a completely virtual world void of human to human interaction. The creator of the game dies and creates a game within "The Oasis" that will give the winner ownership rights to the company that controls "The Oasis".</p>
                                
                                <p>A bunch of kids defeat some bad corporate types and eventually win ownership. As part of the "New Oasis", under the leadership of the kids, they decide to close access to "The Oasis" once a week (Thursdays). They Break Free for at least one day from the digital world.</p>
                                
                                <p>Could we motivate kids to do that today? Is this the new "Ice Bucket Challenge"?</p>

                                <p>Perhaps CNN through their "CNN Original Series" will elect to take on the underlying theme of Michael Smerconish's "The Mingle Effect" and produce a series or a short documentary hosted by their own Michael Smerconish to explore this pivotal moment in time for our kids, grandkids and future children globally.</p>
                                
                                <p>If CNN does not wish to take on this project, perhaps we can find another media company that will want to explore "The Mingle Project's" issues.</p>
                                
                                <p>So, if you're a media company bigwig who understands "The Mingle Project's" message of concern, get in touch with Michael or myself ASAP (But I am hoping CNN's Sir Mark Thompson is a very bright guy!) I personally don't know anyone with a title.... Although Meghan Markle once visited the cottage (Hart and Bonnie) beside my former cottage on Bigwin Island...</p>
